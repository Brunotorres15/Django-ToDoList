The users can check their to do lists by going to the View page where they are gonna be able to click in any of the lists and be redirected to that specific
list page with its specifics tasks and add new tasks to it also they can mark the checkbox to the completed tasks and save them. The user can hit /logout to logout and be redirected to the home page.
